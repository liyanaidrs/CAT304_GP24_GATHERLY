# **EVENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM WITH QR IDENTIFICATION**


## INTRODUCTION
Event management has become increasingly challenging as organizers strive to offer efficient and engaging experiences to attendees.<br><br>
Traditional methods of event tracking, attendee registration, information sharing, and communication often fall short, leading to inefficiencies and decreased attendee satisfaction.<br><br>
This project introduces a modern Event Management System (EMS) that leverages QR identification to enhance event management processes.<br><br>
The system focuses on volunteering events, providing organizers with tools to monitor attendees, share real-time updates, and enable seamless communication between attendees and organizers.<br><br>
